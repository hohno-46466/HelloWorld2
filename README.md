Step 1. Create a Repository

To create a new repository
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.
5. Click Create repository.


Step 2. Create a Branch

To create a new branch
1. Go to your new repository hello-world.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
4. Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.
Now you have two branches, master and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.


Step 3. Make and commit changes

1. Click the README.md file.
2. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click Commit changes button.
These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-editsbranch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.


Step 4. Open a Pull Request

1. Open a Pull Request for changes to the README
2. Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
3. In the Example Comparisonsbox, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).
4. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
5. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
6. When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!


Step 5. Merge your Pull Request

1. Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
2. Click Confirm merge.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
To learn more about the power of Pull Requests, we recommend reading the GitHub flow Guide. You might also visit GitHub Explore and get involved in an Open Source project.
